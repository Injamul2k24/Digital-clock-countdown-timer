## Digital Clock and Countdown Timer

### Project Description
This project involves the creation of a digital clock and a countdown timer using Python. It serves as a practical demonstration of Python programming skills and time-based application development.

### Key Features
1. **Digital Clock**:
   - Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
   - Updates in real-time to reflect the current system time.

2. **Countdown Timer**:
   - Allows users to set a specific duration for countdown.
   - Visual display of remaining time.
   - Provides an alert (visual/audible) when the countdown reaches zero.

### Functions and Modules Used
1. **Digital Clock**:
   - `time` module: To fetch the current time.
   - `datetime` module: For date and time manipulation.
   - `tkinter` module: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

2. **Countdown Timer**:
   - `tkinter` module: For GUI and user input handling.
   - `time` module: To manage the countdown duration and intervals.
   - Custom functions to handle the countdown logic and alert mechanisms.

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Python Skills**:
   - Practical application of Python modules like `time`, `datetime`, and `tkinter`.
   - Improved understanding of GUI development and event handling.

2. **Project Management Experience**:
   - Experience in planning, developing, and testing a software project.
   - Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills.

3. **User Experience Focus**:
   - Developed an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - Addressed user needs by incorporating real-time updates and customizable features.

4. **Portfolio Enhancement**:
   - A demonstrable project that showcases programming and application development skills.
   - Adds a practical, user-oriented project to the portfolio, appealing to potential employers.
